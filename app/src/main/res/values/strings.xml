    <string name="info">Thank you for using Quest RPC. To use the app you need to sign in to Discord and then give the app accessibility permission. This is required for the App to detect what game you are playing. I can see the logo of a game when someone starts it, because of Discords limitations for the presence icon. \nIf you have any questions feel free to ask on SideQuest, GitHub,...</string>
