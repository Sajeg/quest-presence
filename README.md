## Getting Started

1. **Download and Install** 
   __I can only recommend installing it through [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/app/38617/quest-rpc)__
   Download the APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/Sajeg/quest-rpc/releases) section. Follow any of the many available tutorials for sideloading APKs, such as [this video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CZlLjLMuM).

2. **Setup and Permissions**  
   - Open the app and enable it as an Accessibility Service.
   - Sign in with Discord to allow the app to display your status as online.  
   
3. **Customize Presence**  
   You can modify app names or exclude certain apps from appearing in your Discord presence settings.

## FAQ

**Q: Does it collect my Discord password?**  
**A:** No, the app only uses a token provided by Discord during sign-in to manage your online presence.

**Q: Why does it need Accessibility Service permissions?**  
**A:** Accessibility permissions allow Quest RPC to detect the currently open app, enabling it to display this information as your Discord status.

**Q: Does it collect data about me?**
**A:** I wish I could say, no but because the app displays the icon of the game in the presence it gets send to a Discord channel, which only I can access and there you can only see the icons. Not which person send them.
